## Who This Template Is For

- Teams that want secure defaults for new repositories.
- Projects that need language-agnostic CI and policy enforcement.
- Claude-led development that routes simple work to local models and complex work to Claude.

## Requirements

- Git with SSH access to GitHub.
- Docker with Dev Containers support.
- VS Code with Dev Containers extension.
- Access to GitHub Actions in target repositories.
- Optional local model endpoint on host port 11434.
- Claude CLI authentication available before first coding session.
- Caveman installer checksum configured for deterministic startup verification.

### Local AI Prerequisite (Ollama on host:11434)

If you want local-model offload, install and run Ollama on your host machine (not inside the container).

Linux quick path:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://ollama.com/install.sh | sh
ollama serve
```

Pull at least one model:

```bash
ollama pull qwen2.5-coder:7b
```

Verify host endpoint before opening devcontainer:

```bash
curl http://localhost:11434/api/tags
```

This template maps container access to host via host.docker.internal and firewall rules allow only host gateway tcp/11434.

#### Bind Ollama so the container can reach it

By default Ollama listens on `127.0.0.1:11434` (loopback only). The dev container
reaches the host over a separate gateway address, so a loopback-only Ollama is
**not reachable from the container** — `curl http://host.docker.internal:11434`
fails with connection refused. You must bind Ollama to `0.0.0.0` on the host.

Pick the method matching how Ollama runs on your host:

- **systemd** (most Linux installs):
  ```bash
  sudo mkdir -p /etc/systemd/system/ollama.service.d
  sudo tee /etc/systemd/system/ollama.service.d/override.conf >/dev/null <<'EOF'
  [Service]
  Environment="OLLAMA_HOST=0.0.0.0:11434"
  EOF
  sudo systemctl daemon-reload
  sudo systemctl restart ollama
  ```
- **manual foreground:** `OLLAMA_HOST=0.0.0.0:11434 ollama serve`
- **docker:** `-p 0.0.0.0:11434:11434` and `-e OLLAMA_HOST=0.0.0.0`
- **snap:** `sudo snap set ollama host=0.0.0.0:11434`

Confirm the bind before opening the devcontainer:

```bash
ss -tlnp | grep 11434   # expect 0.0.0.0:11434 (or *:11434), not 127.0.0.1:11434
```

> **⚠️ Security disclaimer — you accept this risk.**
> Binding `0.0.0.0` exposes Ollama on **every** host interface, including your
> LAN/Wi-Fi IP. **Ollama has no authentication** — anyone who can route to your
> host on tcp/11434 can run models and consume your GPU/CPU. This is safe only on
> a **trusted network you control**. On public, office, or shared Wi-Fi, do not
> use `0.0.0.0`; instead bind the container gateway address only, or firewall
> tcp/11434 to the container subnet. If you do not accept this exposure, set
> `LOCAL_MODEL_ENABLED=false` in `.env` and routing falls back to Claude.

### Claude Credential Prerequisite

Claude auth is stored in a mounted user config volume and persists across container restarts.

Before first coding session inside devcontainer:

1. Open terminal in container.
2. Run `claude auth login`.
3. Complete the browser auth flow.
4. Verify with `claude auth status` (expect `"loggedIn": true`).

### GitHub Credential Prerequisite

GitHub auth follows the same pattern: interactive browser OAuth, credentials in a
named volume outside the workspace, never in env vars or repo files. Env-var tokens
(`GITHUB_TOKEN`/`GH_TOKEN`) are deliberately not passed into the container — any
process in the container (including agents) could read them, and they tend to leak
into logs and shell history. `scripts/check-day0.sh` fails if one is set.

1. Open terminal in container.
2. Run `gh auth login --hostname github.com --git-protocol https --web` and complete
   the browser flow (in a Claude Code session, type `! gh auth login --web`).
3. Run `gh auth setup-git` so git push/pull over https uses gh as credential helper.
4. Verify with `gh auth status`.

The token lives in `~/.config/gh` (the `claude-code-ghconfig` volume) and persists
across container rebuilds.

The mounted path is `/home/node/.claude` and is intentionally outside repository files to prevent accidental credential commits.

### Caveman Installer Verification Prerequisite

This template verifies the pinned Caveman installer script checksum before executing it.

- Default env var used by startup: `CAVEMAN_INSTALL_SHA256`
- Update this value when bumping `CAVEMAN_VERSION` in `scripts/install-caveman.sh`
- If checksum does not match, startup aborts Caveman installation by design

## Quick Start

1. Create a new repository from this template.
2. Clone with SSH and open in VS Code.
3. Reopen in devcontainer.
4. Let post-start bootstrap run automatically:
   - firewall setup (IPv4 + IPv6 deny-by-default)
   - Caveman token compression install
   - BMAD workflow install
   - pre-commit hooks install
   - Claude Code official plugins install (skill-creator, frontend-design, code-review, superpowers, commit-commands)
   - day-0 auto-setup (`scripts/setup-day0.sh`): copies `.env` + `.claude/settings.json`, fills CODEOWNERS from the git remote, re-installs any missing Claude plugin, and (once gh is authenticated) applies the GitHub + Kanban bootstraps

Note: startup is intentionally deterministic; pre-commit hook versions are not auto-updated unless `PRECOMMIT_AUTOUPDATE=1` is set.

5. Authenticate — the only manual steps (two interactive browser logins, no tokens on disk):
   - `gh auth login --hostname github.com --git-protocol https --web -s project`, then `gh auth setup-git`
     (`-s project` grants the Kanban/Projects scope in the same login; already logged in? add it with `gh auth refresh -s project`)
   - `claude auth login`
6. Re-run the auto-setup so the now-unblocked GitHub + Kanban bootstraps apply, then verify:

```bash
bash scripts/setup-day0.sh   # applies the auth-gated bootstraps, then prints status
bash scripts/check-day0.sh   # verify — expect all green
```

7. Push initial commit so CI checks exist.

## Day 0 Setup

Most of day-0 now runs **automatically** on container start via
`scripts/setup-day0.sh` (the last step of `postStartCommand`). The only steps that
still need a human are the interactive auth flows.

### Automatic on build (no action needed)

| Step | Handled by |
|------|-----------|
| Copy env config (`cp .env.example .env`) | `setup-day0.sh` (skips if `.env` already exists) |
| Copy Claude MCP config (`.claude/settings.json`) | `setup-day0.sh` (skips if it already exists) |
| Populate CODEOWNERS | `setup-day0.sh` derives the owner from the git remote (warns if it looks like an org — orgs need `@org/team`, not a bare `@org`) |
| Claude plugins | postStartCommand; `setup-day0.sh` re-installs any missing plugin on re-run |
| Apply GitHub branch-protection ruleset | `setup-day0.sh`, best-effort **once gh is authenticated** (passes `ADMIN_BYPASS=true` so admins keep a break-glass bypass) |
| Allow Actions to create/approve PRs | `bootstrap-github-settings.sh` (applied with the ruleset; needed by template-sync) |
| Create the Kanban board | `setup-day0.sh`, best-effort **once gh has the `project` scope** |

The two GitHub bootstraps need auth (below), so they apply on the **re-run** of
`setup-day0.sh` after you authenticate — or on the next container start.

### Manual (interactive auth — the only human steps)

Two browser logins. No tokens ever touch env vars or repo files.

| Step | Command | Why it's manual |
|------|---------|-----------------|
| Authenticate gh (browser OAuth) | `gh auth login --hostname github.com --git-protocol https --web -s project`, then `gh auth setup-git` | Interactive browser login; `-s project` grants the Kanban/Projects scope in the same flow; the OAuth token stays in gh's config volume — never in env vars or repo files |
| Authenticate Claude | `claude auth login` | Interactive browser login |
| Finish the bootstraps | `bash scripts/setup-day0.sh` | Re-run after auth so the GitHub ruleset + board bootstraps apply (also runs on the next container start) |

If gh was already logged in without the Projects scope, add it with
`gh auth refresh -s project`.

### Optional

| Step | Command | Notes |
|------|---------|-------|
| Add `TEMPLATE_SYNC_TOKEN` secret | Fine-grained PAT: contents + pull requests + workflows write | Only needed when a template-sync PR changes `.github/workflows/` files; falls back to `GITHUB_TOKEN` otherwise |
| Install Ollama | See [Ollama docs](https://ollama.com) | Only needed for local model routing; `check-day0.sh` reports it as a non-blocking WARN when unreachable |

The manual bootstrap commands remain available as a fallback:
`APPLY=true bash scripts/bootstrap-github-settings.sh` and
`APPLY=true bash scripts/bootstrap-project.sh`.

Run `bash scripts/check-day0.sh` at any time to see which steps are still pending;
`setup-day0.sh` prints the same status plus the exact next commands at the end of every run.

`bootstrap-github-settings.sh` configures a repository **ruleset**
(`Main_Branch_Protections`, targeting the default branch), not legacy branch
protection. It is idempotent — creates the ruleset if absent, updates it in place
otherwise. The ruleset requires a pull request with approving review(s), passing
status checks (`validate-template`, `semgrep`, `gitleaks`), linear history, and
blocks force-pushes / deletions / direct pushes to the branch.

Bootstrap safety defaults:
- dry-run unless `APPLY=true` (prints the exact ruleset payload)
- only the default branch is targeted unless `REQUIRE_DEFAULT_BRANCH=false`
- refuses to require code-owner reviews while `.github/CODEOWNERS` is unset or still
  the shipped placeholder owner (override with `REQUIRE_CODEOWNERS=false`)
- no admin bypass by default (admins are held to the same gates); the automated
  `setup-day0.sh` run passes `ADMIN_BYPASS=true` for a solo-repo break-glass, and
  manual callers can opt in the same way
- pre-change snapshots are saved under `.ai/bootstrap-snapshots` for rollback

## Security Model

- Deny-by-default egress firewall in devcontainer (IPv4 + IPv6). Use `/firewall-allow` to add a new egress host to the allowlist.
- Host access limited to local model endpoint on TCP 11434.
- Secrets blocked locally by pre-commit and in CI by gitleaks workflow.
- Semgrep policy checks in local and CI workflows with SARIF upload to GitHub Security tab.
- Default-branch ruleset (required PR reviews + required status checks, no force-push/deletion) configured by the bootstrap script.

See [SECURITY.md](../SECURITY.md) for leak response guidance.

## PII & Privacy Controls

Protection is layered across two surfaces: **repo commits** and **Claude context**.

### Commit-time PII detection (gitleaks)

The following PII types are blocked at pre-commit and re-checked in CI:

| PII Type | Rule ID | Notes |
|----------|---------|-------|
| Email addresses | `pii-email` | Test domains (example.com, localhost) are allowlisted |
| Credit card numbers | `pii-credit-card` | Common test card numbers (Stripe, PayPal) are allowlisted |
| US Social Security Numbers | `pii-ssn` | Invalid SSN prefix ranges excluded to reduce false positives |
| UK National Insurance Numbers | `pii-uk-nino` | Specific format; low false positive rate |
| Phone numbers (E.164) | `pii-phone-e164` | Only structured international format; TV placeholder numbers allowlisted |

In addition, the built-in gitleaks ruleset (100+ rules) covers all common API keys and tokens: AWS, GitHub, Stripe, Slack, Google, Azure, Twilio, Sendgrid, Shopify, and more.

All PII rules skip `tests/` and `docs/` paths by default. To add a custom allowlist for your project, add entries to `.gitleaks.toml`.

### Code-time PII detection (semgrep)

| Rule ID | What it catches | Languages |
|---------|----------------|-----------|
| `pii-literal-email-in-code` | Hardcoded real email addresses in string literals | Python, JS, TS |
| `pii-in-log-call` | PII-named variables passed to logging/print calls | Python, JS, TS |
| `atlas-t0040-pii-in-prompt` | PII field names interpolated into LLM f-string prompts | Python |

### Claude context protection (PII-Shield)

[PII-Shield](https://github.com/gregmos/PII-Shield) anonymizes content *before it reaches Claude* — replacing names, emails, phone numbers, and other PII with reversible placeholders that are restored in Claude's response. This is complementary to git hooks (which protect the repo), not a substitute.

PII-Shield cannot be installed via `claude plugin install` — it uses a `.mcpb` bundle format. Manual setup:
1. Download the `.mcpb` file from [gregmos/PII-Shield](https://github.com/gregmos/PII-Shield)
2. In Claude Code: **Settings → Extensions → drag in the `.mcpb` file**
3. First run downloads a ~634 MB NER model (one-time)
4. Mappings expire after 7 days by default

## CI and Quality Gates

- Universal checks:
   - secret-scan workflow (gitleaks full history scan)
   - semgrep workflow (custom rules + `p/secrets` + `p/security-audit` community packs, SARIF output)
   - container-scan workflow (Trivy CVE scan, weekly + on devcontainer changes).
     The devcontainer is a local dev sandbox behind a deny-by-default firewall,
     not a shipped artifact, so the gate **blocks only on CRITICAL** findings
     while CRITICAL+HIGH are still reported to the Security tab for visibility.
     Base-image OS CVEs are kept clear by `apt-get upgrade` in the Dockerfile;
     the base digest is refreshed via Dependabot.
   - repository-audit workflow (validates required files and CODEOWNERS customisation)
- Project marker detection for language-specific checks.
- If a stack marker exists and expected scripts are missing under `scripts/ci`, CI fails by design.

## BMAD Workflow

BMAD is the default delivery framework for planning and execution.

BMAD bootstrap is validation-only. It does not auto-generate workflow docs at startup.
Keep `docs/BMAD_WORKFLOW.md` authored in-repo and update it per project via normal commits.

Stage flow:
1. discovery
2. requirements
3. architecture
4. task decomposition
5. implementation
6. security and release readiness

See [docs/BMAD_WORKFLOW.md](BMAD_WORKFLOW.md).

## Kanban & Agent Orchestration

A per-repo GitHub Project v2 board turns BMAD planning into trackable work that a
human orchestrator hands off to Claude sessions or local models — solo, or across
a team without agents stepping on each other. It is entirely `gh`-CLI driven:
**no API keys, no secrets, no Claude-in-CI**. Claude acts through your
interactive session and `gh`.

- Columns: `Backlog → Todo → Ready → In Progress → In Review → Done`.
- Fields: **BMAD Stage** and **Route** (Human / Claude / Local, derived from
  `scripts/route-model.sh` via `scripts/suggest-route.sh`).
- Coordination: a collision-safe **claim protocol** (`scripts/board.sh claim` —
  self-assign + `wip` lock + In Progress + re-check), one branch per issue, and
  git worktrees for parallel subagents.

Setup is two commands (`gh auth refresh -s project`, then
`APPLY=true bash scripts/bootstrap-project.sh`). Populate the board from planning
with `/bmad-to-board`, then build cards with `/next-issue` or orchestrate an epic
with `/run-epic`. Full playbook (solo + team) in
[docs/KANBAN_WORKFLOW.md](KANBAN_WORKFLOW.md).

## Claude Code Skills and Plugins

### Official plugins (auto-installed at startup)

| Plugin | Source | Purpose |
|--------|--------|---------|
| `skill-creator` | `claude-plugins-official` | Create new custom skills for this repo |
| `frontend-design` | `claude-plugins-official` | UI/UX design assistance with a11y and performance focus |
| `code-review` | `claude-plugins-official` | Code review workflow |
| `superpowers` | `claude-plugins-official` | Enhanced capabilities and full-context mode |
| `commit-commands` | `claude-plugins-official` | Git commit workflow assistance |

The `github` plugin is intentionally not installed: its MCP server requires a
`GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN` env var, which this template's no-tokens-in-env
policy forbids. All GitHub operations (PRs, issues, board) go through the
browser-OAuth-authenticated `gh` CLI instead.

Semgrep scanning runs CI-side with the free OSS engine and the repo's `.semgrep.yml`
rules (see `.github/workflows/semgrep.yml`) — no Semgrep Guardian plugin, login, or
`SEMGREP_APP_TOKEN` is needed. The Guardian plugin is intentionally not installed:
its PreToolUse hook blocks tool calls in sessions without a paid Semgrep login.

Plugins are installed by `scripts/install-claude-plugins.sh` at container startup. They persist in the Claude Code config volume across rebuilds. Re-run `bash scripts/install-claude-plugins.sh` manually if a plugin is missing.

### Project-specific custom skills

These slash commands are defined in `.claude/commands/` and are specific to this template's tooling:

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `/bmad` | Start a BMAD planning session for the current task |
| `/bmad-to-board` | Turn a BMAD decomposition into epic + story issues on the Kanban board |
| `/next-issue` | Claim the next ready card (collision-safe), build it, open a PR |
| `/run-epic` | Take ownership of an epic and fan its stories out to subagents |
| `/route-task` | Invoke the model routing protocol explicitly |
| `/day0-check` | Validate day-0 setup and get guided remediation |
| `/security-audit` | Full security scan with MITRE ATLAS + PII coverage mapping |
| `/firewall-allow` | Add an egress host to the dev container firewall allowlist |

## Caveman and Token Controls

Caveman installs automatically in `lite` mode on first devcontainer start, verified against a pinned SHA256 checksum.

### Activating Caveman in a Claude Code session

Caveman is installed into `/home/node/.claude` and activates automatically with the configured default mode. To change mode within a session:

- `/caveman lite` — enable lite compression (default; minimal prompt restructuring)
- `/caveman full` — enable full compression (maximum savings; more aggressive reformatting)
- `/caveman off` — disable for the current session

To verify the installed version and mode:

```bash
cat ~/.claude/.caveman-default-mode
cat ~/.claude/.template-caveman-version
```

To update the version, change `CAVEMAN_VERSION` in `scripts/install-caveman.sh` and update `CAVEMAN_INSTALL_SHA256` in `devcontainer.json`, then rebuild the container.

### Model routing and cost controls

- Model routing policy uses local endpoint for low-risk tasks and Claude for high-risk tasks.
- Disable local routing with `CAVEMAN_ENABLED=0` or `LOCAL_MODEL_ENABLED=false`.
- Recommended local defaults:
   - `qwen2.5-coder:7b` for normal coding tasks
   - `qwen2.5-coder:1.5b-base` for fast/simple edits
   - escalate to Claude for high-risk or ambiguous changes
- Optional fast-path env controls:
   - `LOCAL_MODEL_FAST_MODEL=qwen2.5-coder:1.5b-base`
   - `LOCAL_MODEL_FAST_TASK_TYPES=format,docs,tiny-refactor,rename,simple-test`

See [docs/AI_ROUTING_POLICY.md](AI_ROUTING_POLICY.md) and `scripts/route-model.sh`.

## Secrets Handling

- Never commit credentials or API keys.
- Keep Claude auth in mounted config outside workspace files.
- Use `.env.example` as a template only — never commit `.env`.
- Store CI secrets in GitHub Secrets or Environments.

## What Propagates vs Manual Setup

Propagates from template files:
- workflows, scripts, docs, pre-commit config — kept up to date after repo
  creation by the template-sync workflow (see
  [Template Updates](#template-updates-downstream-sync))

Automatic per new repository (on container start, via `scripts/setup-day0.sh`):
- copy `.env` + `.claude/settings.json` from the shipped examples
- populate CODEOWNERS from the git remote owner
- apply the branch-protection ruleset and create the Kanban board — best-effort,
  once `gh` is authenticated (re-run `setup-day0.sh` after auth to trigger them)

Manual per new repository:
- authenticate Claude and `gh` (interactive OAuth — the only unavoidable human step)
- enable or verify repository-level security settings in GitHub if org rulesets are not centrally managed

## Compatibility Matrix

| Component | Default Pin |
|-----------|------------|
| BMAD | 6.9.0 (`scripts/install-bmad.sh`) |
| Caveman | v1.9.0 (`scripts/install-caveman.sh`) |
| Semgrep | pinned by image digest in `semgrep.yml`, tracked by Dependabot |
| Gitleaks | pinned by image digest in `secret-scan.yml`, tracked by Dependabot |
| Trivy | pinned by action SHA in `container-scan.yml`, tracked by Dependabot |

## Version and Upgrade Policy

- Use semantic tags for template releases.
- Keep tool pins explicit in scripts and workflows.
- Accept upgrades through reviewed pull requests (Dependabot or manual).

## Template Updates (Downstream Sync)

GitHub templates are one-time snapshots: a fix landing in this repo does not
reach repos already created from it. The `template-sync` workflow
(`.github/workflows/template-sync.yml`) closes that gap. It ships with the
template, so every derived repo carries it from day one; weekly (and on manual
`workflow_dispatch`) it pulls the template's `main` and opens a PR labeled
`template-sync` containing the diff — reviewed and merged like any other PR.
The template repo itself skips the job via a repository guard.

What syncs and what doesn't:
- Files listed in `.templatesyncignore` (README.md, CODEOWNERS, .env.example,
  LICENSE) are never overwritten; extend that file with any project paths that
  should stay divergent. Each repo owns its copy — the ignore file itself is
  not synced.
- Files that exist only in the derived repo (your source tree) are never
  touched.

### Conflict behavior — read before merging a sync PR

The sync merges with `-X theirs`: when you and the template edited the **same
lines** of a synced file, the sync PR arrives with the **template's version —
silently proposing to revert your local edit**. Nothing blocks and there are no
conflict markers; the only signal is the PR diff itself. So review sync PRs
specifically for unexpected reverts of local customizations. Edits to
*different* lines or files merge cleanly and both survive.

This default is deliberate: the sync uses squash merges, so git records no
merge base, and without `-X theirs` every previously resolved divergence would
re-conflict on every future sync. Handle divergence by kind:
- **Transient** (you fixed something the template later fixed differently):
  accept the template version, or edit the sync PR branch before merging.
- **Permanent** (intentional per-project customization of a template file):
  add the path to `.templatesyncignore` so it stops being proposed at all.
- **Conflict-heavy sync** (too tangled to review as a diff): close the sync PR
  and do a real merge locally with full conflict markers —
  `git remote add template https://github.com/Moon-Knight13/claude_template_repo`
  (once), then `git fetch template && git merge template/main` (add
  `--allow-unrelated-histories` the first time). After that first merge, git
  has a recorded base and future manual merges are incremental.

Setup per derived repo (one-time):
- Enable Settings > Actions > General > Workflow permissions >
  "Allow GitHub Actions to create and approve pull requests".
- The default `GITHUB_TOKEN` is sufficient until a sync PR needs to change
  files under `.github/workflows/` — pushing those requires the `workflow`
  scope. For that, add a fine-grained PAT (contents: write, pull requests:
  write, workflows: write, scoped to the repo) as the `TEMPLATE_SYNC_TOKEN`
  secret; the workflow falls back to `GITHUB_TOKEN` when the secret is absent.

Repos created before the workflow existed can retrofit it with
`bash scripts/adopt-template-sync.sh` (fetches the two files from the template
via `gh` and prints the setup steps).

Possible future refinements (not implemented): converting the security
workflows to reusable `workflow_call` workflows referenced by tag, and
publishing a prebuilt devcontainer image — both would shrink the file surface
that needs syncing at all.

## Troubleshooting

- Local model unreachable: verify host service and port 11434.
- Local model unreachable from container: verify host endpoint with `curl http://localhost:11434/api/tags` on host, then check devcontainer firewall output.
- Claude auth missing in container: run `claude auth login` inside container and confirm `claude auth status` reports `"loggedIn": true`.
- Bootstrap permission error: ensure gh auth user is repo admin.
- CI missing script failure: add matching scripts under `scripts/ci` for detected stack.
- Gitleaks false positive on a test file: add the file path to the rule's `paths` allowlist in `.gitleaks.toml`.
- Semgrep PII false positive: add the file pattern to the rule's `paths.exclude` list in `.semgrep.yml`.

## FAQ

**Q: Template or fork?**
A: Use template for new projects. Fork only when contributing back to this repository.

**Q: Can I disable optional layers?**
A: Yes. Use `CAVEMAN_ENABLED=0` or `BMAD_ENABLED=0` in environment.

**Q: The gitleaks PII rules are flagging test data — what do I do?**
A: Either move test data to `tests/` (already allowlisted) or use placeholder values (`test@example.com`, `000-00-0000`). For custom allowlists, add entries to `.gitleaks.toml`.

**Q: Does PII-Shield work offline?**
A: The NER model runs locally after the initial download, but PII-Shield still sends the anonymized content to Claude via the Anthropic API.
